Counterfeit IC Detection System
Introduction
Counterfeit electronic chips are a growing concern worldwide, impacting manufacturers, engineers, and users by sneaking fake components into supply chains. These fake ICs can cause device failures, security issues, and costly disruptions. Traditional detection methods like X-ray or electrical testing work but tend to be expensive and slow.
This project presents an alternative: using standard optical images and deep learning models to detect counterfeit integrated circuits quickly and non-destructively. The system uses computer vision to analyze chip images and classify them as real or fake automatically.
What’s Inside
•	Image-based detection driven by deep learning — no specialized or expensive lab equipment needed.
•	Utilizes the powerful yet efficient MobileNetV2 model, fine-tuned for this specific problem.
•	Employs transfer learning from ImageNet to leverage pre-trained features.
•	Applies strong regularization techniques like dropout and L2 penalty to avoid overfitting.
•	Implements training enhancements including early stopping, learning rate scheduling, and model checkpointing for robust, reliable training.
•	Comprehensive evaluation with metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
Why This Matters
Fake or tampered electronic parts pose serious risks in every industry that relies on electronics—from consumer products to critical infrastructure. Offering an accessible and fast way to identify counterfeit ICs can help improve supply chain security and device reliability across many applications.
How It Works
1.	Data Preparation:
The model is trained on a dataset of labeled optical images, divided into authentic and counterfeit IC classes. Images go through preprocessing steps such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation to enhance model generalization.
2.	Model Architecture:
MobileNetV2 is the backbone model, chosen for its efficiency and accuracy. The last 30 layers are unfrozen and fine-tuned using low learning rates to tailor the pre-trained network for counterfeit detection.
3.	Training and Regularization:
The training pipeline includes L2 weight regularization and 50% dropout layers to prevent overfitting. Batch normalization speeds up and stabilizes training. Early stopping halts training when validation performance stagnates, while learning rates are adaptively reduced on plateaus. The best model checkpoint is saved automatically.
4.	Evaluation:
The model’s performance is assessed on unseen test data with metrics like overall accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores, complemented by confusion matrices to identify specific error types.
Results
•	Overall Test Accuracy: 82.35%
•	Authentic ICs (Class 0):
•	Precision: 100% (no false positives)
•	Recall: 40%
•	F1 Score: 57%
•	Counterfeit ICs (Class 1):
•	Precision: 80%
•	Recall: 100% (no misses)
•	F1 Score: 89%
This means the model never misses a counterfeit chip in the test set and does not misclassify any genuine chip as counterfeit. Such performance is valuable in scenarios where catching every fake is critical.
What We Learned & Next Steps
•	Transfer learning significantly jumps starts training, especially helpful with limited data.
•	Regularization and data augmentation are key to maintaining model robustness.
•	Further improvements could come from enlarging the dataset, trying other architectures like EfficientNet, or using ensemble models for better accuracy.
•	More aggressive augmentation and fine hyperparameter tuning could reduce false negatives and improve recall further.
